##Hanoi

Hanoi is recursive!
It's an example of an algorithm naturally amenable to recursion.

The example is using "a" as the source and "b" as the sink ("c" is temp storage!)

$ is for changing precedence of function application
=> is 


Code Review Stack Exchange comment below

Thanks for the reply! 

I wasn't familiar with the $ and => operators, so I added some explanation below.

$ evidently changes the precedence of function application (reduces the number of parentheses required.)

=> is used in type signatures to specify class constraints.

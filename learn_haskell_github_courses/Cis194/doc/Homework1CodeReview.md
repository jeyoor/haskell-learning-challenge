I am working through the [UPenn CIS194](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) lectures and homework assignments in an effort to learn more about Haskell.

The first part of Homework 1 is focused on validating credit card numbers.







##TODO: post this as a comment after posting question.
There is already a question regarding the content of the [first assignment](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/104876/upenn-cis-194-homework-1-validating-credit-card-numbers) (validating credit card numbers).
